In Mexican folklore, the onza is a legendary cat species.

### Name origin
The Spanish name *onza* derives from the Latin *lynx*, *lyncis*, and is equivalent to the English word *ounce*, originally applied to the lynx but now more commonly to the snow leopard (Uncia uncia).
There are old texts written by Spanish conquistadors about the onza, but they might refer to the *jaguarundi*, which is known as onza in many Mexican states. *Onça* is the Brazilian Portuguese word for jaguar, Panthera onca, where a spotted jaguar is known as *onça-pintada* and a melanistic one as *onça-preta*.

### Legends
In one legend, after the Spaniards settled in Mexico, the animal was seen more often, and some unidentified group of people gave it the name *onza*. Some missionaries described these creatures in their letters.

#### The Mysterious Mr. Vega
In this legend, the only viable specimen to have been examined was contributed by a rancher named Andres Murillo. In January 1986, he shot what he thought was a jaguar attacking him. Although there's no explanation of who proved it or how, the story goes on to say that it was proved not to be a jaguar. Murillo brought the specimen to a person identified only as "Vega", who was said to own a nearby ranch. There it was found to be a female weighing 60 lb (27 kg) and measuring 45 inches (1.1 m) long without the 23 inches (58 cm)-long tail. The story claims the animals were much like cougars but had lighter frames with longer, striped legs, longer ears, and a longer tail. It also claimed this particular cat had the appearance of a cougar with a very long, thin body and long, thin, doglike legs. Deer had been found in its stomach, supposedly indicating that it had eaten recently. The ranch owner referred to as Vega told Murillo that the specimen greatly resembled what he called an "onza" that his father had shot in the 1970s, the skull of which he still had.
