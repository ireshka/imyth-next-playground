The **bakeneko** ("changed cat") is a type of Japanese *yōkai*, or supernatural entity; more specifically, it is a *kaibyō*, or supernatural cat. It is often confused with the *nekomata*, another cat-like yōkai. The distinction between them is often ambiguous, but the largest difference is that the nekomata has two tails, while the bakeneko has only one.
