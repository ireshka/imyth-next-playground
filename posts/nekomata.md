**Nekomata** are a kind of cat *yōkai* described in Chinese and then Japanese folklore, classical kaidan, essays, etc. There are two very different types: those that live in the mountains and domestic cats that have grown old and transformed into yōkai. Nekomata are often confused with *bakeneko*.

## Senri
In Chinese lore there is a cat yōkai called *senri* ("leopard cat"). In this telling, leopard cats that grow old gain a divine spiritual power, shapeshift into a beautiful man or woman, and suck the spirit out of humans.

Some theorize that the Japanese nekomata legends derive from Chinese senri tales.
